//! The icons the session list's rows and buttons wear.
//!
//! The desktop draws these from two places: the brand pack under
//! `apps/desktop/assets/icons/`, and `gpui-component`'s own Lucide set for the
//! handful of plain controls (`Plus`, `Ellipsis`, `ChevronDown`,
//! `ChevronRight`). A terminal cannot read either at run time, so the icons a
//! row needs are bundled here — the desktop pack for the ones it already
//! carries, and the phone's Lucide copy for the controls the component set
//! owns and this repository has no embeddable copy of.
//!
//! The shapes are the desktop's own, and deliberately so: a reader who knows
//! the sidebar on one screen has to recognise the buttons on the other. Every
//! entry therefore carries the asset path it is, and a test asserts the file
//! says what the entry claims — a control that quietly drifted to a different
//! picture would be a different button wearing the same verb.
//!
//! # Two renderings, one vocabulary
//!
//! A button has to be drawn on *every* terminal, and a picture is only drawn
//! where the terminal speaks an image protocol. So each icon has both
//! renderings: the SVG the desktop draws (turned into a PNG by
//! [`crate::row_marks`], the same path an Agent's brand mark takes), and a
//! character for the terminals that cannot hold a picture. The character is
//! tier-aware like the rest of [`crate::glyphs`], and both renderings are the
//! same two columns wide, so a row does not reflow when the terminal's
//! capabilities change.
