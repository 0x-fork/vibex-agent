//! Which mark belongs to which Agent, and the bytes of that mark.
//!
//! Every Vibex client that lists Agents — the desktop workbench, the phone, and
//! the terminal — answers the same question: given whatever the runtime calls an
//! Agent, which brand mark is it? The answer has to be the same everywhere or
//! the same Agent wears two faces, so it lives here once rather than in each
//! client.
//!
//! # The identity is a string, not an id
//!
//! The match is deliberately loose. The runtime's `AgentId` is whatever an
//! Agent definition declared, and a reader's own Agent can be an arbitrary ACP
//! command; the mark is therefore chosen from the Agent's id, its label, its
//! command and its preset joined together — so a custom Agent whose command is
//! `opencode` wears the OpenCode mark, exactly as the desktop decides it. A
//! caller builds that string with [`identity`] rather than joining it itself,
//! because the order and separators are part of the answer.
//!
//! # What a mark is not
//!
//! A mark is either *colored* (it carries its own brand colours) or *themed*
//! (it is drawn in the reader's foreground). That one bit is the whole of the
//! metadata a renderer needs, and it is deliberately also the whole of what
//! crosses into this crate from the desktop's asset table: positions, sizes and
//! intrinsic widths are a renderer's business, not a brand's.
//!
//! # Rasterization is a feature
//!
//! A client that has its own renderer (a GPUI window, an SVG engine) wants only
//! [`agent_mark`]. A client that has to produce pixels — the terminal, whose
//! image protocol wants a PNG — turns on `raster` and calls [`mark_png`].
