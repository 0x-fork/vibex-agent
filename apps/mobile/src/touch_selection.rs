//! What the app adds to the touch selection the kit draws.
//!
//! A long press that lands on text is the kit's gesture: it takes the word
//! under the finger, paints a handle at each end of it, and opens its own
//! Copy / Select All menu over it. Two things a phone expects of that toolbar
//! are missing from it, and both are the app's to add.
//!
//! **A tick.** Taking a selection is the only confirmation the gesture gets
//! before the finger lifts, and every native selection gives it. It is asked
//! for when the touch selection *appears*: a handle drag and a scroll both end
//! with the menu reopening over a selection that never went away, and ticking
//! there too would make the phone buzz at the end of every gesture.
//!
//! **A way out.** The kit's Copy closes the menu and keeps the selection —
//! highlight, handles and all — which on a phone reads as "the button did
//! nothing", because the screen still shows everything it showed before. The
//! press itself cannot be hooked: the menu belongs to the kit, and its items
//! call into the kit's own state. It is read off the mouse instead, on the
//! release: a left button going up over a live touch selection with its menu
//! shut and no handle in hand is a release the menu consumed. The read happens
//! on the capture pass and the release is deferred to the end of the effect
//! cycle — the menu is an occluding popup that stops the event before the
//! bubble reaches a layer mounted this early, and the item's own action has to
//! run before the selection is let go. Nothing else reaches that state — a
//! press on the text clears the selection, a press on a handle leaves it
//! dragging until the menu reopens, a tap on the selection reopens the menu
//! where it stands, Select All reopens it over the whole message, and a scroll
//! never releases a button at all.
//!
//! Both selections the app shows are covered: the window selection over
//! message text, and the composer's own, which the kit keeps inside the input.
