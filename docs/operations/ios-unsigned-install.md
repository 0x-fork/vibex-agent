# Installing the Unsigned iOS Build

`vibex-<version>-ios-unsigned.ipa` is a complete arm64 device build of the Vibex
mobile client. It is produced without an Apple account: no certificate, no
provisioning profile, no App Store Connect credentials, and no paid membership.

iOS refuses to execute code it has not signed, so this file cannot be installed
on a stock device as it stands. Whoever installs it supplies the signature by
re-signing the bundle with their own Apple ID, which is free. That split is the
whole point of the artifact: the build side stays account-free, and the install
side uses the cheapest credential Apple offers.

| Step | Apple account required |
| --- | --- |
| Producing the IPA | No |
| Installing it on a device | A free Apple ID, or a device covered by TrollStore |
| App Store or TestFlight distribution | Yes, and a paid membership |

The signed lifetime of a free-account re-signature is seven days. After that the
app stops launching until it is signed again.

## Producing the build

### From GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/mobile-ios-unsigned.yml` builds the IPA on demand. It needs no
repository secrets and no Apple account; the macOS runner is free on a public
repository.

1. Push the workflow to the default branch. `workflow_dispatch` only lists a
   workflow that already exists there.
2. Open **Actions → Mobile iOS Unsigned IPA → Run workflow**. Leave the version
   input empty to stamp the version declared in `apps/mobile/Cargo.toml`.
3. Download `mobile-ios-unsigned-<sha>` from the finished run and unzip it.

The tagged release workflow publishes the same file as
`vibex-<version>-ios-unsigned.ipa` alongside the XCFramework and the simulator
bundle, so a release always carries a device artifact.

### On a Mac

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
pnpm build:mobile:ios
pnpm package:mobile:ios
```

`package:mobile:ios` builds the device bundle and writes the IPA plus its
SHA-256 sidecar to `target/mobile-ios-artifacts/`. Set `VIBEX_MOBILE_VERSION` to
override the stamped version. Both steps need macOS with Xcode, because the
device link resolves the iOS SDK through `xcrun`; the script re-runs
`build:mobile:ios` by itself when the XCFramework is missing.

## Installing the build

Every option below re-signs the bundle with the installer's own credentials.
Only install a build you got from a source you trust: re-signing replaces the
signature entirely, so it proves nothing about who produced the binary.

### Sideloadly (Windows or macOS)

Drag the IPA into Sideloadly, enter a free Apple ID, and start. The tool signs
the bundle, installs it over USB, and repeats the process when the seven-day
signature expires.

### AltStore or SideStore

Both re-sign with a free Apple ID and refresh in the background. AltStore keeps
AltServer running on a computer on the same network. SideStore refreshes
on-device after a one-time pairing setup.

A free Apple ID covers at most three installed apps at a time and about ten new
App IDs per week, so a device that already carries three sideloaded apps must
free a slot first.

### Xcode with a personal team

Open `apps/mobile/ios/Vibex.xcodeproj`, select the `Vibex` target, set your Apple
ID under **Signing & Capabilities** with **Automatically manage signing**, and
run against the device. Xcode registers the device and issues the free profile.
This is the same flow as any other personal-team build.

### TrollStore

TrollStore installs the IPA permanently without any account, but it relies on a
CoreTrust bug that only exists on iOS 14.0 through 16.6.1 and 17.0. The client
requires iOS 17.0 or newer, so this covers a device sitting on exactly 17.0 and
nothing else.

## Why free-account re-signing works here

Free Apple IDs cannot sign apps that request managed entitlements. The mobile
client requests none, which is what makes the unsigned artifact practical:

- Notifications are local. `apps/mobile/ios/Vibex/Notifications.m` schedules
  them through `UNUserNotificationCenter` with no server push, so the app needs
  no `aps-environment` entitlement.
- LAN discovery only browses Bonjour. `apps/mobile/ios/Vibex/LanDiscovery.m`
  runs an `NSNetServiceBrowser`, which is covered by the `NSBonjourServices` and
  `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` keys already in `apps/mobile/ios/project.yml`
  and needs no multicast entitlement.
- The project carries no `.entitlements` file at all.

Adding a capability that needs a managed entitlement would break this path, so
treat that as a deliberate trade-off rather than a detail.

## Verifying the download

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c vibex-<version>-ios-unsigned.ipa.sha256
unzip -l vibex-<version>-ios-unsigned.ipa | head
```

The archive must contain `Payload/Vibex.app/` at its root. The bundle inside
carries no `_CodeSignature` directory and no `embedded.mobileprovision`; the
packaging script refuses to emit an IPA whose bundle does carry them, so the
`unsigned` in the filename always describes the contents.
